                    <p>The Theatre Collection Site is designed to track and manage daily gross and net revenue from theaters. Different roles include distributors, who oversee revenue data; admins, who manage the system and data integrity; and theater staff users, who input daily earnings. The system provides a centralized platform for recording gross (total) and net (post-deduction) revenues, offering real-time reports to monitor performance, identify trends, and ensure transparent financial management.</p>
                    <p>Distributor: Responsible for overseeing and possibly managing multiple theaters. They can access reports and insights into the revenue collected from all theaters under their network. This role may have authority to adjust targets, review detailed revenue metrics, and communicate directly with theater operators.
                        Admin: Admins typically manage and configure the system. They handle user access permissions, data integrity, and ensure accurate recording and reporting of revenue. Admins can generate reports, review data entries, and oversee compliance with policies.
                        User (e.g., Theater Staff): Responsible for entering daily revenue data, including gross revenue (total earnings before deductions) and net revenue (earnings after expenses, taxes, or commissions). They log daily ticket sales, concessions, and other income sources..</p>
